# SafeDrive AI ‚Äì Intelligent & Secure Cloud Gateway

An advanced research and engineering project delivering a modern full-stack application for AI-driven file scanning and secure cloud storage integration. Designed with a strong focus on privacy protection, the system leverages React 18 + TypeScript for a high-performance, user-centric frontend and Flask (Python) for a robust, scalable backend. Styled with Tailwind CSS and seamlessly integrated with Google Drive, the solution combines cutting-edge AI, cryptography, and cloud deployment practices, culminating in a production-ready environment deployed via Docker on AWS EC2.

## üì© Access to the Service (Limited Testing Phase)

SafeDrive AI is currently in a **restricted access phase** due to Google OAuth verification requirements for Google Drive API integration. This process can take several weeks to months. Until verification is complete, only **registered test users** can use the service.

If you would like to try SafeDrive AI during this phase:

1. Send an email request to one of the following addresses:  
   - üìß zinebadammiche03@gmail.com  
   - üìß zinebsaraoui11@gmail.com
2. Include in your email:  
   - Your **Google account email** (the one you‚Äôll use to log in)  
   - A short note that you‚Äôd like to join the tester list
3. Once we add you as a tester, access the service here:  
   üëâ **Live Demo**: https://safe-drive-ai-frontend-mq6j.vercel.app

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Create a `.env` file **for the backend** (values are examples‚Äîreplace with your own):

```env
# Flask
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
FLASK_ENV=production

# CORS / CSRF
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://safe-drive-ai-frontend-mq6j.vercel.app
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true
SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE=None

# Google OAuth2
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=https://13-39-110-169.sslip.io/auth/callback

# API
API_BASE_URL=https://13-39-110-169.sslip.io

 


Frontend .env file (Vite)

VITE_API_BASE=https://13-39-110-169.sslip.io
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
No localhost: This deployment uses the public Vercel frontend and sslip.io backend domains exclusively.

üß™ Health Checks & Troubleshooting
Verify CORS: backend must allow origin https://safe-drive-ai-frontend-mq6j.vercel.app and include Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true.

Ensure cookies are set with Secure and SameSite=None for cross-site OAuth flows.

For Redis-backed features, confirm REDIS_URL is reachable from the backend container.

Confirm Google OAuth test users are whitelisted in Google Cloud Console.
